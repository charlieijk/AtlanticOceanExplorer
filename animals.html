                <h3>Starfish</h3>
                <img src="images/starfish.jpg" alt="Starfish">
                <p>Starfish, or sea stars, are echinoderms known for their distinctive star-shaped appearance.
                    They're found in various colors and sizes across the Atlantic Ocean's floor.</p>
                <h3>Starfish Fun Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regenerative Abilities: Starfish are known for their remarkable ability to regenerate lost
                        arms. In some species, an entire new starfish can grow from just a portion of a severed
                        limb.</li>
                    <li>No Brain, But Eyes: They don't have a brain, but possess a complex nervous system and have
                        tiny eyes at the end of each arm.</li>
                    <li>Diverse Diet: They are predators, primarily feeding on mollusks. Some can even invert their
                        stomachs to digest food outside their bodies.</li>
                    <li>Variety of Species: There are about 2,000 species of starfish, found in a variety of colors
                        and sizes, across the world's oceans.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="images/blobfish.jpg" alt="Blobfish">
                <p>The blobfish is a deep-sea fish known for its unique, gelatinous structure that allows it to
                    survive at high pressures in the depths of the Atlantic.</p>
                <h3>Blobfish Fun Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unique Adaptation: Blobfish have a gelatinous consistency, less dense than water, allowing
                        them to float above the sea floor without expending energy on swimming.</li>
                    <li>Deep-Sea Dweller: Found at depths of 600-1,200 meters, where pressure is several dozen times
                        higher than at sea level.</li>
                    <li>Endangered: They are endangered due to deep-sea fishing. Their habitat is often destroyed by
                        bottom trawling nets.</li>
                    <li>Appearance Change: The blobfish's notable 'blobby' appearance occurs because it decompresses
                        when brought to the surface.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Vampire Squid Fun Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Misnomer: Despite its name, the vampire squid is not a true squid. It belongs to its own
                        order, Vampyromorphida, which is more closely related to octopuses.</li>
                    <li>Bioluminescence: They can produce light through photophores to disorient predators or prey.
                    </li>
                    <li>Deep-Sea Dweller: Lives in the aphotic zone of tropical and temperate oceans, at depths of
                        600-900 meters.</li>
                    <li>Unique Defense Mechanism: When threatened, the vampire squid inverts its capelike webbing,
                        displaying large spines, which are actually harmless.</li>

                <p>Sawfish are known for their long, saw-like rostrums, which are effective tools for hunting in the
                    murky waters of the Atlantic.</p>
                <h3>Sawfish Fun Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Distinctive Rostrum: Their most notable feature is their long, flat rostrum (snout), lined
                        with teeth, resembling a saw.</li>
                    <li>Long Lifespan: They are known to live up to 25-30 years in the wild</li>
                    <li>Endangered Species: All species of sawfish are listed as endangered or critically
                        endangered, mainly due to fishing and habitat loss.</li>
                    <li>Electroreceptors: They use their rostrum as a tool for hunting. It's equipped with
                        electroreceptors to detect prey and can slash in the water to incapacitate or kill fish.

                <ol>
                    <li>Base: Phytoplankton, microscopic plant-like organisms, form the base. They perform
                        photosynthesis, converting sunlight into energy, and are the primary producers in this
                        ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>Primary Consumers: Zooplankton, small marine animals like krill, and small fish feed on
                        phytoplankton.</li>
                    <li>Secondary Consumers: Larger fish, such as herring and mackerel, consume zooplankton and
                        smaller fish.</li>
                    <li>Tertiary Consumers: Predatory fish like tuna and sharks, as well as marine mammals like
                        dolphins and whales, feed on the larger fish.</li>
                    <li>Decomposers: Bacteria and other microorganisms decompose dead organisms, returning nutrients
                        to the water.</li>

                <h3>Starfish Behaviours</h3>
                <img src="images/starfishtwo.jpg" alt="starfishtwo">
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeding Behavior: Starfish are known for their unique feeding method. Many species feed by
                        everting their stomachs out of their bodies and over digestible parts of their prey, such as
                        mussels and clams.</li>
                    <li>Locomotion: Starfish move using hundreds of tiny tube feet located on their undersides.
                        These tube feet operate through a water vascular system, allowing the starfish to walk
                        slowly across the sea floor.</li>
                    <li>Regeneration: A well-known behavior of starfish is their ability to regenerate lost arms.
                        This is not only a defense mechanism but also a way to reproduce in some species, as a new
                        individual can grow from a severed limb.</li>

                <h3>Blobfish Behaviours</h3>
                <img src="images/blobfishcousins.jpg" alt="Blobfish Two">
                <ul>
                    <li>Passive Feeding: The blobfish primarily feeds on edible matter that floats by, such as small
                        crustaceans, sea pens, and other marine debris. It's believed to be a passive feeder, not
                        actively hunting for its food but rather consuming whatever comes within reach.</li>
                    <li>Minimal Movement: Due to its gelatinous body and the high-pressure environment it lives in,
                        the blobfish likely moves very little. Its body is primarily adapted to float just above the
                        seafloor without expending much energy.</li>
                    <li>Buoyancy Control: The blobfish's jelly-like body is slightly less dense than water, which
                        allows it to float above the sea floor without swimming. This adaptation helps it conserve
                        energy in the nutrient-scarce depths of the ocean.</li>
