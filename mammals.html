        <h2 id="diversitybanner">Did You Know? - Fascinating Whale Facts</h2>

        <section id="funfacts">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep Divers:</strong> Did you know that some whale species are among the deepest divers in
                    the animal kingdom? The sperm whale, for instance, can dive more than 2,000 meters deep and hold its
                    breath for up to 90 minutes!</li>
                <li><strong>Long Migrations:</strong> Whales undertake some of the longest migrations of any animal. The
                    humpback whale travels up to 5,000 miles each way between its feeding grounds in polar regions and
                    breeding grounds in tropical waters.</li>
                <li><strong>Vocal Champions:</strong> The blue whale, the largest animal on the planet, is also one of
                    the loudest. Its calls, reaching up to 188 decibels, can be heard over hundreds of miles underwater.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ancient Ancestors:</strong> Whales’ ancestors were actually land-dwelling mammals! Over
                    millions of years, they evolved into the fully aquatic creatures we know today, a transition
                    evidenced by their vestigial leg bones.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Feeding Techniques:</strong> Some whales use unique feeding methods. For instance,
                    humpback whales use a technique called 'bubble net feeding', where they create a circle of bubbles
                    to trap schools of fish before swooping up to consume them.</li>
                <li><strong>Massive Heart:</strong> The heart of a blue whale is as large as a small car and can weigh
                    up to 400 kilograms (880 pounds). It beats only five to six times per minute when the whale dives.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Long Lifespans:</strong> Many whale species have long lifespans. The bowhead whale, found in
                    Arctic waters, is one of the longest-living mammals, with some individuals estimated to be over 200
                    years old.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Sleepers:</strong> Unlike humans, whales never fully fall asleep. Instead, they rest
                    one hemisphere of their brain at a time, allowing them to continue breathing and staying alert to
                    potential dangers in their environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Behaviors:</strong> Whales exhibit complex social behaviors and can pass on
                    cultural practices, like hunting techniques and vocalizations, from one generation to the next.</li>
                <li><strong>Conservation Success Stories:</strong> The ban on commercial whaling has led to the recovery
                    of several whale populations. The humpback whale, once endangered, has seen significant population
                    increases since the 1960s.</li>
